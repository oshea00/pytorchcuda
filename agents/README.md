# Agents from scratch

This is an experiment using Claude 3.7 to design and create an "agentic framework" using only barebones dependencies and raw openai (or openai-compatible) API calls.

# Example of creating a calculator

The description given to the program for the calculator program:
'Create a cli scientific calculator using sympy that runs in a REPL loop and also accepts an expression from the command line'

The resulting code is in the ```calculator_dir```

# Instructions for use

## Prerequisites
- Docker 
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- Python environment has ```openai``` package.

Run the script:
```
python3 agents_from_scratch_docker.py
```

Answer the prompts.
